# World_Weather_Analysis

## New assigment 

After developing a code using APIs to track the weather and hotels localization around the world to get a Betta of the app PlanMyTrip, the management executieves suggested a few changes to take the app to the next level. 

Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data using the input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Also, from the list of potential travel destinations, we will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary using the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. 

For this, we made a long trip between the states of Baja California and Baja California Sur in MÃ©xico and California in the US, you need to have your passport and visa to make this trip with us!
